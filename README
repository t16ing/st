st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

For example on Ubuntu, install libx11-dev and libxft-dev as well:

    sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

To install to another destination:

    DESTDIR=$HOME/local make clean install

For Ubuntu, to install as x-terminal-emulator:

    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator x-terminal-emulator /usr/local/bin/st 10
    sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator

Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
